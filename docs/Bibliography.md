I have many people to thank for their assistance and contributions to this project:
- `Dr. Vineetha Menon`: Dr. Menon was my advisor for this project. She helped to keep this project on its timeline and ensured that the goals outlined in `KeyDecisions.md` were met.
    - TODO: link Key Decisions
- `Ms. Abigail Aho`: Abigail was my proofreader throughout the varius stages of this project. She ensured that all of my user-facing documentation was thorough and easy to understand. She was also a great sanity check for making sure I conveyed my thoughts clearly.
- `Testers`: There were many people who tested this software at various points in its life cycle. This helped a lot with finding bugs, clearifying UI and generally ensuring the plugin's success.

Additionally, the following literature provided much insight into both the Music Theory aspects of this software as well as the technical implementation details:
- Musescore Documentation (Official)
- UAH Theory Textbook
- QML Documentation
- Chord Identifier Plugin (implementation)
- Random theory rules document on internet (I know which one this is)

TODO: Put all the things here
