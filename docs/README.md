# Part-Writing Error Identifier  Musescore Plugin

## Introduction
Most collegiate music students will take a sequence of music theory courses during their collegiate career. One of the skills students learn in these course is traditional part writing. Part-writing can be complicated and many students struggle to learn the difficult process. Because part-writing is so complex, it can often take instructors extended amounts of time to grade and provide feedback to students. This lack of feedback often means it is difficult for students to learn from their mistakes and make improvements in the future.

It can also be difficult for students to study independently, as students on their own as most students struggle with assessing their own work, or even the work of their classmates.
