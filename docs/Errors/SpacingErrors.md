# Spacing Errors
Spacing Errors occur when two parts are spread too far apart. 

## Example
TODO: Insert image

For Example, in the image above, the spacing between the soprano and the alto is greater than an octave, thus a spacing error has occurred.

## Default Configuration
- Soprano - Alto: Perfect Octave
- Alto - Tenor: Perfect Octave
- Tenor - Bass: Perfect 15va (2 Octaves)
