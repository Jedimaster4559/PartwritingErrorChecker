# Melodic Dissonance Errors
Melodic Dissonances occur when an augmented or diminished interval occurs melodically within a single part.

## Description
Melodic Dissonances most frequently occur in minor between the 6th and 7th scale degrees. When using a harmonic minor scale, the interval here is an augmented second. It can be easy to overlook this one as it doesn't stand out as much as some other errors do. While this is the most common occurrence of this error, it should is not the only occurring one.

## Example

The example above has this error. Note in the soprano line the movement from `Db` to `E`. The interval is an augmented second, which is not allowed.

## Additional Notes
This ended up being a pretty neat check to implement. See ![Interesting Notes](#../InterestingNotes) for more details.
