# Installation
First download the plugin from the releases page: [https://github.com/Jedimaster4559/HonorsCapstoneProject/releases](https://github.com/Jedimaster4559/HonorsCapstoneProject/releases)
To install this plugin, copy the `errorIdentifier.qml` file into Musescore's Plugins directory. This is often placed in one of a couple locations. See the following page for more details on installation [https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins#installation](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins#installation)

TODO: Expand this guide, perhaps with some custom more detailed instructions
TODO: Add Visuals
